When government spending exceeds the revenue collected through taxes and other sources, it creates a deficit.
To pay for the deficit, the government borrows funds, which creates debt. One of the primary ways to finance debt
is for the Department of the Treasury to issue securities to investors. Securities are investments that can be
purchased by individuals, corporations, Federal Reserve Banks, federal agencies, and other governments.

### Who are the primary investors in U.S. debt?

The chart below shows the top 10 owners of U.S. debt, who control a combined $25.60 Trillion (83%) of the total debt (as of August 2022).
It includes individual investors, the Federal Reserve, federal trust funds and government agencies, and foreign entities.

The sale of securities to finance the U.S. government dates back to the late 1700s when private citizens purchased over
$27 million in bonds to support the American Revolution<AnchorText link={footnotes[0].anchors[0].link} text={footnotes[0].anchors[0].text} />. Throughout U.S. history, there have been other efforts to fund
specific government activities such as the Louisiana Purchase, the building of the Panama Canal, and many of the nation’s wars.
In addition to individual or corporate investors, the Federal Reserve buys and sells U.S. securities as tools for macroeconomic policy,
collateral for U.S. currency, and to manage reserve balances as authorized by the Federal Reserve Act. At the end of August 2022,
U.S. investors and the Federal Reserve held a combined 54% of the total debt.

### How much debt do foreign holders own?

You may hear a lot about foreign debt holders in the news, but it may surprise you to know that
the top foreign debt holders have not changed much over time. In 1994, the top three countries
were Japan, China, and the United Kingdom, which remain unchanged today. Like domestic ownership,
foreign debt ownership can include individuals, corporations, and governments. These debt holdings
can be divided into short and long-term securities, and investors in various countries may prefer
one over the other. In Japan (the country holding the largest foreign percentage of U.S. securities),
94% of its U.S. holdings are in long-term securities. This is typical for Asian countries; however,
other countries tend to hold a more even split between long- and short-term, such as countries in
the Caribbean (53% U.S. holdings in long-term)<AnchorText link={footnotes[1].anchors[0].link} text={footnotes[1].anchors[0].text} />.

### What are Intragovernmental Holdings?

Intragovernmental Holdings make up 22% of the total debt. They are usually held in government trust funds,
such as the Social Security Trust Funds or the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The U.S. government
invests in these funds to provide future payments, such as retirement funds for government employees. Rather than
let the money invested just sit in the funds until they’re needed, they may be borrowed against to use for other purposes.
The chart below shows how this borrowing compares to both domestic and foreign debt ownership. Typically, domestic and
foreign debt ownership are combined and called “Debt Held by the Public.”

Securities are purchased with the belief that the government will be able to repay the loan amount plus interest when it is due.
Like all borrowers, the government relies on this good faith and its creditworthiness to be able to continue borrowing. Historically,
investors have had high confidence that U.S. securities are a safe, sound investment. This confidence provides stability for the
government to finance deficits when needed.

  This analysis was created using the [Monthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD)](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-statement-public-debt/summary-of-treasury-securities-outstanding)
  as the data source for the federal debt of the United States. Treasury securities were identified using three sources: the MSPD, which contains
  detailed information on trust funds that own Treasury securities; the [Treasury International Capital (TIC)](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt)
  System, which identifies foreign holders of U.S. federal debt; and the [System Open Market Account (SOMA)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma-holdings)
  Holdings of Domestic Securities, which reports Federal Reserve holdings of Treasury securities. The breakdown for foreign debt ownership by short-
  and long-term securities uses additional data from the [Treasury International Capital (TIC)](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt3d.txt) System.
  A history of U.S. savings bonds is available at [TreasuryDirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/timeline.htm).
