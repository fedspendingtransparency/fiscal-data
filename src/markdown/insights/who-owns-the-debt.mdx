<!-- When government spending exceeds the revenue collected through taxes and other sources, it creates a deficit. -->
<!-- To pay for the deficit, the government borrows funds, which creates debt. One of the primary ways to finance debt -->
<!-- is for the Department of the Treasury to issue securities to investors. Securities are investments that can be -->
<!-- purchased by individuals, corporations, Federal Reserve Banks, federal agencies, and other governments. -->

<!-- ### Who are the primary investors in U.S. debt? -->

<!-- The chart below shows the top 10 owners of U.S. debt, who control a combined $25.60 Trillion (83%) of the total debt (as of August 2022). -->
<!-- It includes individual investors, the Federal Reserve, federal trust funds and government agencies, and foreign entities. -->

<!-- The sale of securities to finance the U.S. government dates back to the late 1700s when private citizens purchased over -->
<!-- $27 million in bonds to support the American Revolution<AnchorText link={footnotes[0].anchors[0].link} text={footnotes[0].anchors[0].text} />. -->
<!-- Throughout U.S. history, there have been other efforts to fund specific government activities such as the Louisiana Purchase, the building of the -->
<!-- Panama Canal, and many of the nation’s wars. In addition to individual or corporate investors, the Federal Reserve buys and sells U.S. securities as -->
<!-- tools for macroeconomic policy, collateral for U.S. currency, and to manage reserve balances as authorized by the Federal Reserve Act. -->
<!-- At the end of August 2022, U.S. investors and the Federal Reserve held a combined 54% of the total debt. -->

<!-- ### How much debt do foreign holders own? -->

<!-- You may hear a lot about foreign debt holders in the news, but it may surprise you to know that -->
<!-- the top foreign debt holders have not changed much over time. In 1994, the top three countries -->
<!-- were Japan, China, and the United Kingdom, which remain unchanged today. Like domestic ownership, -->
<!-- foreign debt ownership can include individuals, corporations, and governments. These debt holdings -->
<!-- can be divided into short and long-term securities, and investors in various countries may prefer -->
<!-- one over the other. In Japan (the country holding the largest foreign percentage of U.S. securities), -->
<!-- 94% of its U.S. holdings are in long-term securities. This is typical for Asian countries; however, -->
<!-- other countries tend to hold a more even split between long- and short-term, such as countries in -->
<!-- the Caribbean (53% U.S. holdings in long-term)<AnchorText link={footnotes[1].anchors[0].link} text={footnotes[1].anchors[0].text} />. -->

<!-- ### What are Intragovernmental Holdings? -->

<!-- Intragovernmental Holdings make up 22% of the total debt. They are usually held in government trust funds, -->
<!-- such as the Social Security Trust Funds or the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The U.S. government -->
<!-- invests in these funds to provide future payments, such as retirement funds for government employees. Rather than -->
<!-- let the money invested just sit in the funds until they’re needed, they may be borrowed against to use for other purposes. -->
<!-- The chart below shows how this borrowing compares to both domestic and foreign debt ownership. Typically, domestic and -->
<!-- foreign debt ownership are combined and called “Debt Held by the Public.” -->

<!-- Securities are purchased with the belief that the government will be able to repay the loan amount plus interest when it is due. -->
<!-- Like all borrowers, the government relies on this good faith and its creditworthiness to be able to continue borrowing. Historically, -->
<!-- investors have had high confidence that U.S. securities are a safe, sound investment. This confidence provides stability for the -->
<!-- government to finance deficits when needed. -->

<!--   This analysis was created using the [Monthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD)](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-statement-public-debt/summary-of-treasury-securities-outstanding) -->
<!--   as the data source for the federal debt of the United States. Treasury securities were identified using three sources: the MSPD, which contains -->
<!--   detailed information on trust funds that own Treasury securities; the [Treasury International Capital (TIC)](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt) -->
<!--   System, which identifies foreign holders of U.S. federal debt; and the [System Open Market Account (SOMA)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma-holdings) -->
<!--   Holdings of Domestic Securities, which reports Federal Reserve holdings of Treasury securities. The breakdown for foreign debt ownership by short- -->
<!--   and long-term securities uses additional data from the [Treasury International Capital (TIC)](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt3d.txt) System. -->
