<section id='why-datasets-go-further-than-others'>

### Why do some datasets go back further than others?

The answer varies by dataset. Some data started being recorded as the result of
specific legislation and others became available as a result of new data systems put in
place. We strive to provide as much data as is available for each dataset and will
continue working to provide as much historical data as possible.
