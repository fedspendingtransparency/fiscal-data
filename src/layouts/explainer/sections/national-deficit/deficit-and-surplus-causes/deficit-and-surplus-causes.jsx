        The size of the national deficit or surplus is largely influenced by the health of the economy and spending and revenue policies set by
        Congress and the President. The health of the economy is often evaluated by the growth in the country’s {gdp}, fluctuations in the nation’s
        employment rates, and the stability of prices. Simply put, when the country’s people and businesses are making less money, the amount
        collected by the government also decreases. Similarly, when the economy is doing well and people and businesses are earning more money, the
        government collects more. On the spending side, the increase or decrease of spending also impacts the budget, creating deficits or surpluses.

        Legislation increasing {spendingLink} on Social Security, health care, and defense that outpace {revenueLink} can increase the deficit. While
        revenue increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, from approximately $3.5 trillion in 2019 to $4 trillion in 2021, increased government spending
        related to widespread unemployment and health care caused spikes in the deficit. Visit USAspending.gov to learn more about{' '}
