        The U.S. has carried debt since its inception. Debts incurred during the American Revolutionary War amounted to over $75 million by January 1,
        1791. Over the next 45 years, the debt continued to grow until 1835 when it notably shrank due to the sale of federally-owned lands and cuts
        to the federal budget. Shortly thereafter, an economic depression caused the debt to again grow into the millions. The debt grew over 4,000%
        through the course of the American Civil War, increasing from $65 million in 1860 to $1 billion in 1863 and almost $3 billion shortly after
        the conclusion of the war in 1865. The debt grew steadily into the 20th century and was roughly $22 billion after the country financed its
        involvement in World War I.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notable recent events triggering large spikes in the debt include the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, the 2008 Great Recession, and the COVID-19
        pandemic. From FY 2019 to FY 2021, {spendingLink('spending')} increased by about 50%, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tax cuts, stimulus
        programs, increased government spending, and decreased tax revenue caused by widespread unemployment generally account for sharp rises in the
        national debt.

        Comparing a country’s debt to its {gdp} reveals the country’s ability to pay down its debt. This ratio is considered a better indicator of a
        country’s fiscal situation than just the national debt number because it shows the burden of debt relative to the country’s total economic
        output and therefore its ability to repay it. The U.S. debt to GDP ratio surpassed 100% in 2013 when both debt and GDP were approximately 16.7
        trillion.
