    <p>
      The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is a restriction imposed by Congress on the amount of outstanding national debt that the federal government can
      have. The debt ceiling is the amount that the Treasury can borrow to pay the bills that have become due and pay for future investments. Once the
      debt ceiling is reached, the federal government cannot increase the amount of outstanding debt, losing the ability to pay bills and fund
      programs and services. However, the Treasury can use extraordinary measures authorized by Congress to temporarily suspend certain
      intragovernmental debt allowing it to borrow to fund programs or services for a limited amount of time after it has reached the ceiling.

      Since the United States has never defaulted on its obligations, the scope of the negative repercussions related to a default are unknown but
      would likely have catastrophic repercussions in the United States and in markets across the globe.
