      <p>
        The federal government needs to borrow money to pay its bills when its ongoing {spendingLink('spending')} activities and investments cannot be
        funded by {revenueLink} alone. Decreases in federal revenue are largely due to either a decrease in tax rates or individuals or corporations
        making less money. The national debt enables the federal government to pay for important programs and services even if it does not have funds
        immediately available, often due to a decrease in revenue. Decreases in federal revenue coupled with increased government spending further
        increases the {deficitLink}.

      <p>
        Consistent with the purpose of the federal government established by the U.S. Constitution, money is spent on programs and services to ensure
        the well-being of U.S. residents. The Constitution’s preamble states that the purpose of the federal government is “…to establish Justice,
        insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and
        our Posterity.” Uninterrupted funding of programs and services is critical to residents’ health, welfare, and security.

          In accordance with the 2014 DATA Act, federal agencies are required to submit financial data on a quarterly and/or monthly basis to{' '}
          {USAsGov}. Anyone can visit USAspending for a breakdown of what the federal government spends each year and how it spends that money.
          Visitors can follow the money from the Congressional appropriations to the federal agencies and down to local communities and businesses.
