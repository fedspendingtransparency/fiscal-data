        The federal budget is divided into approximately 20 categories, known as budget functions.
        These categories organize federal spending into topics based on their purpose (e.g.,
        National Defense, Transportation, and Health).

      <h5>What does the government buy?</h5>
      <p>
        The government buys a variety of products and services used to serve the public -
        everything from military aircraft, construction and highway maintenance equipment,
        buildings, and livestock, to research, education, and training. The chart below shows
        the top 10 categories and agencies for federal spending in FY YYYY (latest complete
        fiscal year).

          Each year, the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees publish their Annual
          Report on the Financial Status of Social Security and Medicare. The Boards’ projections
          indicate that spending will continue to increase. As the average age of Americans
          increases, more funding is needed to support entitlement programs like Social Security,
          Medicare, and retirement and disability services for both military and civil servants.
