      <h5>Who controls federal government spending?</h5>
      <p>
        Government spending is broken down into two primary categories: mandatory and discretionary. Mandatory spending represents nearly two-thirds
        of annual federal spending. This type of spending does not require an annual vote by Congress. The second major category is discretionary
        spending. The difference between mandatory and discretionary spending relates to whether spending is dictated by prior law or voted on in the
        annual {appropriations} process. Another type of appropriation spending is called {supplementalAppropriations}, in which spending laws are
        passed to address needs that have arisen after the fiscal year has begun.
      </p>
      <h6>Mandatory Spending</h6>
      <p>
        Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is mandated by existing laws. This type of spending includes funding for entitlement
        programs like Medicare and Social Security and other payments to people, businesses, and state and local governments. For example, the{' '}
        <CustomLink href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/ssact-toc.htm">Social Security Act</CustomLink> requires the government to provide
        payments to beneficiaries based on the amount of money they’ve earned and other factors. Last amended in 2019, the Social Security Act will
        determine the level of federal spending into the future until it is amended again. Due to authorization laws, the funding for these programs
        must be allocated for spending each year, hence the term mandatory.

      <h6>Discretionary Spending</h6>
      <p>
        Discretionary spending is money formally approved by Congress and the President during the appropriations process each year. Generally,
        Congress allocates over half of the discretionary budget towards national defense and the rest to fund the administration of other agencies
        and programs. These programs range from transportation, education, housing, and social service programs, as well as science and environmental
        organizations.

      <p>
        Supplemental appropriations, also known as supplemental spending, are appropriations enacted after the regular annual appropriations when the
        need for funds is too urgent to wait for the next regular appropriations. In 2020, Congress passed four supplemental appropriations to aid the
        nation’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. You can explore the spending related to these supplemental appropriation laws in

          Discretionary spending is determined by the President and Congress each year in the budget and appropriations process. First, the President
          creates a budget proposal and sends it to Congress. Then, the House and Senate both draft budget resolutions. Congress can change funding
          levels and add or eliminate programs, taxes, and other sources of revenue. Once the budget resolutions have been finalized in the House and
          Senate, Congress reconciles the differences and votes on a final budget. The discretionary spending levels in the budget are divided among
          the twelve Appropriations Subcommittees, which then draft bills providing funding levels for the departments, bureaus, and agencies within
          their jurisdiction. After the House and Senate agree to a final funding level for each bill, they are sent to the President for approval or
          veto.
