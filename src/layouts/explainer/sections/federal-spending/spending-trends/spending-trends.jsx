        The federal government spent ${spendingTotal} in FY {fiscalYear}. This means federal spending was equal to {spendingPercent} of the total
        gross domestic product (GDP), or economic activity, of the United States that year. One of the reasons federal spending is compared to GDP is
        to give a reference point for the size of the federal government spending compared with economic activity throughout the entire country.
