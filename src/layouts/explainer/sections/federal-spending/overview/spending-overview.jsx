            The federal government spends money on a variety of goods, programs, and
            services that support the economy and people of the United States. The federal
            government also spends money on the interest it has incurred on outstanding
            federal debt. Consequently, as the debt grows, the spending on interest expense
            also generally grows. If the government spends more than it collects in revenue,
            then there is a budget deficit. If the government spends less than it collects in
            revenue, there is a budget surplus.
          </p>

            If the government spends more than it collects in revenue, then there is a budget
            deficit. If the government spends less than it collects in revenue, there is a
            budget surplus. In fiscal year (FY) YYYY (latest complete fiscal year), the
            government spent $XX.X trillion, which was more/less than it collected
            (revenue), resulting in a deficit/surplus. Visit the {deficit} explainer
            to see how the deficit and revenue compare to federal spending

            Federal government spending pays for everything from Social Security and Medicare
            to military equipment, highway maintenance, building construction, research, and
            education. This spending can be broken down into two primary categories: mandatory
            and discretionary. These purchases can also be classified by object class and
            budget functions.

            Throughout this page, we use outlays to represent spending. This is money that has
            actually been paid out and not just promised to be paid. When issuing a contract or
            grant, the U.S. government enters a binding agreement called an obligation. This
            means the government promises to spend the money, either immediately or in the
            future. As an example, an obligation occurs when a federal agency signs a contract,
            awards a grant, purchases a service, or takes other actions that require it to make
            a payment. Obligations do not always result in payments being made, which is why we
            show actual outlays that reflect actual spending occurring.

            The U.S. Treasury uses the terms “government spending,” “federal spending,” “national
            spending,” and “federal government spending” interchangeably to describe spending by
            the federal government.

        According to the Constitution’s Preamble, the purpose of the federal government is
        “…to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense,
        promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and
        our Posterity.” These goals are achieved through government spending.
