        Most of the revenue the U.S. government collects comes from contributions from individual taxpayers, small businesses, and corporations
        through taxes. Additional sources of tax revenue consist of {excise} tax, estate tax, and other taxes and fees. So far in FY{' '}
        {currentFiscalYear}, individual income taxes have accounted for {indvPercent}% of total revenue while Social Security and Medicare taxes made
        up another {ssPercent}%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government revenue also comes from payments to federal agencies like the U.S. Department of the Interior. Have you visited a national park
        recently? Did you know your national park entry is included in government revenue? Other agencies generate revenue from leases, the sale of
        natural resources, and various usage and licensing fees.

          The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the law that created the Federal Reserve System and established it as the central bank of the United
          States, requires that any excess earnings generated by 12 Federal Reserve Banks be paid to the federal government. In practice, Federal
          Reserve banks pay for their operating expenses, pay a dividend to stockholders (U.S. commercial banks), set aside money in a surplus fund
          (capped at $6.8 billion), and the remainder is “transferred…to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the
          Treasury.” [<i>See</i> {federalReserveAct}]

      <h5>Social Security and Medicare Taxes</h5>
      <p>
        Unlike personal income taxes, which support a variety of programs, these taxes are only used to fund Social Security and Medicare. These funds
        are collected from your paycheck, and in most cases, matched by your employer, and then divided into separate {trustFunds} that support each
        of those programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social Security has two trust fund accounts: the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI) and the Disability Trust Fund (DI). The
        funds in these accounts are responsible for providing workers and their families with retirement, disability, and survivor's insurance
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Medicare also has two accounts: the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (HI), also known as Medicare Part A, and the Supplementary Medicare
        Insurance Trust Fund (SMI). These funds pay for hospital, home health, skilled nursing, and hospice care for the elderly and disabled.

          From 1868 until 1913, 90% of all federal revenue came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine, and tobacco.
