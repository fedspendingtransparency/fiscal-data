              Treasuryâ€™s efforts to increase the redemption of MUD are complicated by issues such as the age and
              quality of MUD records, a paper-based redemption process, as well as reluctance by some bond owners to
              redeem their bonds. Treasury has been working for more than a decade to implement new techniques and
              technologies to reduce the amount of MUD and ensure that the public can access and redeem their matured bonds.
