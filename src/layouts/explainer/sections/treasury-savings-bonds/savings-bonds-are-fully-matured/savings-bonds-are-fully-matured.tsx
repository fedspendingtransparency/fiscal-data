      <p>
        A savings bond can be redeemed anytime after at least one year; however, the longer a bond is held (up to 30 years), the more it earns. When a
        savings bond is redeemed after five years, the owner receives the original value plus all accrued interest. If a bond is redeemed before five
        years, the holder loses the last three months of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, bond owners hold onto bonds after they have reached maturity and are no longer earning interest. These outstanding but
        unredeemed bonds are called {glossaryTerms.maturedUnredeemedDebt}. The government continues to be responsible for this debt, as it may be
        redeemed at any time. Therefore, the Treasury has increased efforts to encourage bondholders to redeem their matured savings bonds. As of{' '}
        {format(new Date(mudMonthYear), 'MMMM y')}, there were {getShortForm(mud, false)} matured unredeemed savings bonds held by investors.
      </p>
      <p>
        If bonds are held past their maturity date, the bonds can lose value due to inflation. To understand how this value is lost, see the
        illustration below.

            Imagine you bought a series EE bond 30 years ago for $500. After 20 years, it doubled in value ($1,000) and continued to earn interest
            ($600) until reaching maturity after 30 years.

            If you redeem your bond today, you can redeem it for $1,600 and spend that on goods or services or reinvest that money in a new savings
            bond.

            If you hold onto that bond and don’t redeem it for another 10 years, it will still be worth $1,600, but the same goods and services you
            would have purchased 10 years ago now cost $2,050, effectively losing you $450 in value.

            Treasury’s efforts to increase the redemption of MUD are complicated by issues such as the age and quality of MUD records, a paper-based
            redemption process, as well as reluctance by some bond owners to redeem their bonds. Treasury has been working for more than a decade to
            implement new techniques and technologies to reduce the amount of MUD and ensure that the public can access and redeem their matured
            bonds.
