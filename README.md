# FDG

UI for `fiscaldata.treasury.gov`

## Style Guide
FDG has a [coding style guide](style-guide.md) that is a work in progress.

## Getting Started
You will need to have Node installed to run this project.
Clone this project using this command:
`git clone https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fiscal-data.git`

Install dependencies:
`npm install`

Start the project on a local server:
`npm start`

You can run unit tests with:
`npm run test`

You can run unit tests with _coverage_ via: 
`npm run tst`

Update the snapshots used in the unit tests with:
`npm run updateSnapshots`

## Post-Build Tests
Post build (integration) tests can be run for any environment once you've run a 
build (for any environment). The post-build test uses Puppeteer and 
defaults to port `9898`. If you have difficulty with using that port,
you can `npm config set post_build_test_port=<port>`. 



## Troubleshoot Issues
Sometimes there might be issues when running `npm install`. Here are a few tips for 
resolving some of these issues. First run the following command:
`npm config list`
`npm install --verbose`

If the installation hangs for more han 10 minutes, type the following on your keyboard:
`[ctrl] + C` to close out the process. This should either continue running or end the installation.
Then type the following command to clean your cache and re-install:
`npm cache clean --force`
`npm install --verbose`

Sometimes the issue might be that you're missing a binding.node file in your `~/<user>/node/` directory.
Check with the dev team about adding the following files to your node folder located in your Windows user directory:
`C:/Users/<user>/node/win32-x64-72_binding.node`
`C:/Users/<user>/node/win32-x64-83_binding.node`

When you're done adding the files try to run the project locally by typing the following command:
`npm run develop-dev`

To view the app on your browser, go to the local host address
`http://localhost:8000/`

When switching branches that contain new packages run:
`npm install --verbose`


## Gatsby Builds
For builds with silent warnings that are also optimized, you can run the gatsby build and serve the app using:
`gatsby build`
`npm run serve`

To remove gatsby cache files when switching environments
`gatsby clean`


## Environment Builds
To see dev builds go to
