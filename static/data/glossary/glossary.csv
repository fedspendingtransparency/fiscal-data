302,Product or Service Code (PSC),"A Product or Service Code (PSC) is a 4-character code that identifies the type of product, service, or research & development (R&D) purchased. While NAICS codes identify the industry most relevant to a contract, PSCs tell you what the contract is specifically purchasing. For example, a contractís NAICS code might point to the ìIndustrial Building Constructionî industry, while that same contractís PSC points to ìConstruct Hospitals and Infirmaries.î There are nearly three times as many PSCs (over 2,900) as there are NAICS codes (just over 1000), which in many cases allows a more granular PSC designation than NAICS code designation for a given contract.

All PSC are 4 characters long, but there is an embedded hierarchy in the codes. 

- **R&D**: begin with ëAí (indicating R&D), followed by a second letter, followed by a number, followed by a number (four levels of hierarchy). Example: AA11.

- **Services**: begin with ëBí to ëZí (indicating the subcategory of Service), followed by a number, followed by two letters (four levels of hierarchy if you include the ìServiceî designation). Example: C1AA

- **Products**: begin with two numbers (indicating the subcategory of Product), followed by two more numbers (three levels of hierarchy if you include the ìProductî designation). Example: 1005",PSC Manual,"https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=PSC_Manual
